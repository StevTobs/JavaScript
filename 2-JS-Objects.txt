// let catName = "Fluffy"
// let catAge = 4

// function neow(){
//   alert("Meoooooowwwwww!")
// }
// How can we write our code in a way so that it's painfully obvious that there is a relationship between the name of the cat the age of the cat and the ability to meow.
//Tha answer is Object!!

let cat ={
  name: "Fluffy", //<--- called "Propoty"
  age: 4,
  foods: {
    favorite: "Tuna",
    leastFavorite: "Oranges"
  },
  eyeColor: "blue",
  meow(){
    alert("Meooooowwwwww")
  }
}

// cat.name

// cat.meow()

cat.foods.favorite
